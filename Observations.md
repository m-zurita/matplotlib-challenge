## Observations

1) From the data analyzed, Ramicane and Capomulin seem to be the only effective drugs. The rest are on par with the Placebo.

2) Drugs seem to be useful in preventing metastatic spread. With the exception of Ketapril, the results indicate that treatments are effective in general.

3) Capomulin and Ramicane also have the highest survival rate. This is to be expected since they provide the best control on Tumor Volume growth.
